# configure-git-on-ubuntu
this is a test repo for configuring my ubuntu linux os to work with git-github

There is a simple hello world shell script program named "first.sh" <br>
to run this program, open up the terminal, go to the directory where "first.sh" is saved, and use the commands below.

```
chmod 755 first.sh
```

```
./first.sh
```
